1. Click on the **CREATE** tab to start building a dataset for the algorithm.
2. In the **ATTRIBUTES** section, select values for each attribute using the dropdown menu. Click **ADD** to incorporate these values into the table.
3. Repeat step 2 until you have completed this process for **four** rows.
4. Click **NEXT** to proceed to the **COMPUTE** page and initiate the candidate elimination algorithm.
5. Click **ITERATE** to identify positive and negative examples within the dataset.
6. Subsequently, click **GENERIC** for each attribute to uncover a more generalized hypothesis.
7. Review the version space to identify boundaries.
8. Next, click **SPECIFIC** for each attribute to uncover a more specific hypothesis.
9. Review the version space again to identify boundaries.
10. Repeat steps 5 and 9 for every instance (example) in the dataset.
11. Now, click on the **FINAL HYPOTHESIS** tab.
12. Click on the **SPACE** button to retrieve the specific and generic hypothesis.
13. Now, click on the **COMPARE** button to get the consistent hypothesis.
14. Repeat the above step (13) to compare each generic value with a specific hypothesis.
